## Numbers ##

The second of Peter the Magician's Puzzle Activities.
Inspired by the TV game, "Letters and Numbers".
Players have to make a target number from 3 single digit numbers using only plus and multiply.
There are 10 levels which can be set by the player.

The inclusion of a scoring mechanism will lead to much competition between students.
